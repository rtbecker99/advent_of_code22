# advent_of_code22
I heard about advent of code online and it seems like something that might be fun to keep myself in practice with. I probably won't do it every day, but will have this repo to track my work.

Maybe I'll try using GDScript since I want to learn that, but right now it's all python. I've been using python for a while, so maybe that could be useful for someone learning how to use Python.
